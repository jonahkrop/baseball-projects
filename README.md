# Baseball Research

All my baseball-related research is here! I started with `statcast_calibrations.html` to make sure the data was as accurate as possible, and I'm using that calibrated data in the rest of my research.

In addition to that exercise in data cleaning, I hope to add research in hit probabilities, strike probabilities, defensive value, and some other various research topics related to those projects.

Some hit probability research should be coming in sooner rather than later.
