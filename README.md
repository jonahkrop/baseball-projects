# Baseball Research

All my baseball-related research is here! I started with `statcast_calibrations.html` to make sure the data was as accurate as possible, and I'm using that calibrated data in the rest of my research.

In addition to that exercise in data cleaning, I hope to add research in hit probabilities, strike probabilities, defensive value, and some other various research topics related to those projects.

The first of the hit probabilities research is in, looking at predicting batted-ball outcomes based on hitter contributions. Coming soon will be a slightly different way of predicting batted-ball outcomes, and then some research with the results, and maybe some parameter tuning.
