# Baseball Research

All my baseball-related research is here! I started with `statcast_calibrations.html` to make sure the data was as accurate as possible, and I'm using that calibrated data in the rest of my research.

In addition to that exercise in data cleaning, I hope to add research in hit probabilities, strike probabilities, defensive value, and some other various research topics related to those projects.

First up, I'm looking at hit probabilities. I researched several different models, ultimately settling on a gradient boosting algorithm, and then did some hyperparameter tuning.
